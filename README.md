# bikesharing

## Overview:
Using Tableau, an analysis of a bike sharing program was completed. 7 visualizations were created to show times of peak use and gender breakdown of the riders in august of 2019.
## Results:
There were 2,344,224 rides taken in august of 2019. Of those rides 1,900,359 were taken by subscribing members of the bike sharing program, and 443,865 were taken by one time customers. Checkout times for all users spike around the 15 minute mark with males being the most likely gender to rent a bike. Rides most commonly occured between 6-9AM and 5-7pm on weekdays and 9am-5pm on weekends, again men being the most likely gender to rent a bike.
## Summary:
In summary we can see the bikes are most likely being used for commuting on the weekdays and for pleasure on the weekends. Most of the rides are being taken by men. The best time for bike mantinence to be performed is from 2am-4am on weekdays. Two more visualizations that could be added to the story are a map of top starting locations and a heatmap of Trips by Weekday for age groups.
